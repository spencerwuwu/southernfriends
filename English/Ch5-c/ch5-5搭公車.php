<p>Rules for calculating the price of one-section fare and two-section fare</p>
<p><img src="img/ch5/05/ch5-5-13png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Depending on section<br>
For routes that a two-section fare is charged, there will be a section point/buffer zone. If you get on a bus at the first section, you pay when boarding, and if you get off the bus at the first section as well, you don’t need to pay again. But if you get off at the second section (beyond the buffer zone), you need to pay one more time. And if you get on a bus at the second section, you only need to pay once because you will get off at a station belonging to the second section. <p>按里程計費<br>
Some of the buses charge depending on mileage. 
If you wish to pay with cash, after you get on a bus, the driver will tell you the price, and you pay all at once. </p></div>
