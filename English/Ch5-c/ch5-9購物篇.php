<p>五金 means "five kinds of metals" (gold, silver, copper, iron, and tin). Originally hardware stores in Taiwan sell these kinds of metals and get the name "五金行". 
Nowadays, besides selling metals, a hardware store also sells some simple tools such as brooms, scissors, pipes, and so on.  </p>

<p>A convenience store usually offers 24/7 service. As its name, several things can be done conveniently. For example, in a convenience store in Taiwan, people can purchase foods and daily necessities, top up their smart cards, pay phone bills, send parcels (some also offers store-to-store parcel delivery service), booking several kinds of tickets, scanning and printing documents, to name but a few. Also, there is usually an automated teller machine set in a convenience store, so people can withdraw money there. </p>
