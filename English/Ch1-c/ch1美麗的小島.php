<p>Taiwan (Republic of China) was formerly referred to as Formosa, which means “beautiful 
island”. Located amongst Ryukyu Islands and Philippine Islands, Taiwan has Taiwan Strait and Europe to the west. Tropic of Cancer crosses through the middle of Taiwan, which brings warm and wet weather and diverse atmosphere and biological environments for organisms. 
Hoklo, Kakka, Chinese mainlanders who immigrated with th e R.O.C government in 1949, and Taiwanese aborigines make up the main occupation. They contributed to the diverse culture in Taiwan.
